## Project Description
Natural language processing (NLP) is a sub field of artificial intelligence and linguistics. It studies the problems of automated generation and understanding of natural human languages.

In the third task we have to solve a problem from this subject, more specially we have to analyze a twitter collection about offensive language and hatred. In addition, we have to create a pair of models able to classify the twitter collection using two classification algorithms.

The collection is stored in a dataset that it has been already labeled by CrowdFlower users. There are three classes:
* Class 0 - Hated Speech: public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or groupbased on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation.
* Class 1 - Offensive language: profanity is language that is sometimes considered by certain parts of a culture tobe strongly impolite, rude, or offensive.
* Class 2 -Neither: Those tweets that doesn’t fit in the previous groups.
